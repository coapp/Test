Miscelaneous automation, documentation, and related materials.

Items contained within this folder are intended solely to make my life easier as the tester.  Most things in here are backups in case all of my present dev environments die a horrible fiery death, so that I won't need to start over from scratch.

Anyone is welcome to view anything contained herein, but I'd ask that any changes be approved by the test lead for the project before being commited.
